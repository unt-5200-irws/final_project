Regardless of the challenges of the global pandemic, we had one of the most productive years of research in UNT's history. Awards were up more than 25% with a record-breaking $50 million in new contracts and grants awarded to our researchers. We saw a dramatic 17% increase in the value of proposals and a 20% increase in research expenditures.\\nRCA 2021 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nIn FY 2021, Research Commercial Agreements (RCA) continued the successes from FY 2020 with high levels of customer service, fast and professional contracting for faculty researchers and explosive growth in the number of licenses. The unit’s radical change in FY 2020 to mix servicing all research contracts with our technology transfer services continued to drive RCA's success.\\nDRI 2020 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nDespite the challenges of this past year with the global pandemic, UNT’s Division of Research and Innovation had an incredible year. More faculty than ever are engaged in sponsored research, and collaborations with national agencies, laboratories and industries are all on the rise. All of this helps us continue our momentum and reinforce our reputation as a world-class research university.\\nRCA 2020 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nUNT’s Research Commercial Agreements (RCA) unit within the Division of Research and Innovation began its first year of operations in FY 2020. The restructured area combines the research contracting function of the division with the commercialization unit, providing a single point of interaction for research connected to sponsors, licensees and collaborators not involved with federal grants.\\nUNT Research Snapshot 2020\\nRead the print version\\nAn interdisciplinary approach to innovation has cemented UNT’s status as a Tier One research university. The Division of Research and Innovation is dedicated to expanding the research enterprise at the university by helping faculty and student researchers push the boundaries of their fields. This past year, the university garnered record amounts of research funding and licensing revenue, but it’s only the beginning.\\nFrequently Used Resources\\nPI Handbook\\nRequest a Grants and Contracts Specialist\\nIRB Protocol Submission\\nDisclose an Invention\\nUNT Research Roadmap\\nTop\\nUniversity Links\\nMyUNT\\nCanvas\\nEagleConnect\\nUNT Directory\\nUNT Map\\nJobs at UNT\\nEmail & Phone\\nUNTResearch@unt.edu\\n940-369-7428\\nUNT TTY: 940-369-8652\\nResearch and Innovation\\nHurley Administration Bldg\\n1155 Union Circle #310979\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDenton, Texas 76203\\nVisitor Information\\nCall us\\nEmail Us\\nMap to Hurley Administration Bldg\\nApply now\\nSchedule a tour\\nGet more info\\nDisclaimer\\nAA/EOE/ADA\\nPrivacy\\nElectronic Accessibility\\nRequired Links\\nUNT Home\\n©2022 University of North Texas\\nRequired Links  \n",

Regardless of the challenges of the global pandemic, we had one of the most productive years of research in UNT's history. Awards were up more than 25% with a record-breaking $50 million in new contracts and grants awarded to our researchers. We saw a dramatic 17% increase in the value of proposals and a 20% increase in research expenditures.\\nRCA 2021 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nIn FY 2021, Research Commercial Agreements (RCA) continued the successes from FY 2020 with high levels of customer service, fast and professional contracting for faculty researchers and explosive growth in the number of licenses. The unit’s radical change in FY 2020 to mix servicing all research contracts with our technology transfer services continued to drive RCA's success.\\nDRI 2020 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nDespite the challenges of this past year with the global pandemic, UNT’s Division of Research and Innovation had an incredible year. More faculty than ever are engaged in sponsored research, and collaborations with national agencies, laboratories and industries are all on the rise. All of this helps us continue our momentum and reinforce our reputation as a world-class research university.\\nRCA 2020 Annual Report\\nRead the print version\\nUNT’s Research Commercial Agreements (RCA) unit within the Division of Research and Innovation began its first year of operations in FY 2020.
